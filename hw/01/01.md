- Anything special?
    - According to Chi Xuebin, deputy director of the Computer Network and Information Center, Tianhe 2 is difficult to use.  

        > It is at the world's frontier in terms of calculation capacity, but
        > the function of the supercomputer is still way behind the ones in the
        > US and Japan... Some users would need years or even a decade to write
        > the necessary code.

    - The location of Tianhe-2 is in Southern China, where the warmer weather with higher temperature could increase the electricity consumption by about 10% compared with a location in Northern China.
